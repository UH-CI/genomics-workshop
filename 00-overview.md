Introduction to Bioinformatics Genomics Data Workshop

# Learning Objectives
* Summarize the learning objectives for the workshop.

In this workshop, we're going to go through running applications against sequence data for processing, data analysis and visualization.  We'll go through

- Setting up the project

        - metadata files
        - project organization

- Processing genomic sequences

        - connecting to a remote computer
        - using bioinformatics tools at the command line
        - automating analyses at the command line

- Analyzing the processed sequence data

        - using R for analyses and visualizations
        - introduce Agave/ToGo to access data and run computation

We'll use an example dataset to go through the initial portions of a generic genomics analysis.
