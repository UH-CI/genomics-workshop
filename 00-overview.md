Introduction to Genomics Data Carpentry workshop

# Learning Objectives
* Summarize the learning objectives for the workshop.

In this workshop, we're going to go from getting sequencing data back through to data analysis and visualization.  We'll go through

- Setting up the project

        - metadata files
        - project organization

- Processing genomic sequences

        - connecting to a remote computer
        - using bioinformatics tools at the command line
        - automating analyses at the command line

- Analyzing the processed sequence data

        - using R for analyses and visualizations

We'll use one dataset from start to finish to go through a full lifecycle of a genomics analysis.
