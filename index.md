This FREE workshop is sponsored by the University of Hawai'i Information Technology Service Cyberinfrastructure group, the Texas Advance Computing Center and Hawaii EPSCoR.


This workshop is for any researcher who has data they want to analyze , and no prior computational experience is required. This hands-on workshop teaches basic concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data.

The focus of this workshop will be on working with genomics data and data management and analysis for genomics research. We will cover metadata organization, data organization, connecting to and using advanced computing, the command line for sequence quality control and bioinformatics workflows, and R for data analysis and visualization. We will not be teaching any particular bioinformatics tools, but the foundational skills that will allow you to conduct any analysis and analyze the output of a genomics pipeline.

Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. Laptops will require a terminal application for accessing compute resources - Linux and Mac machine have this already, for Windows machines we recommend the free home version of [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html) By the end of the workshop learners should be able to more effectively manage and analyze data and be able to apply the tools and approaches directly to their ongoing research.

Please note that registration is limited to 40 attendees.
### Workshop structure

One dataset will be used throughout the workshop. We will start by introducing the dataset and the steps we'll go through for analysis.

### Dataset

In this workshop we're using data from Blount et al 2012 paper from Dr. Richard Lenski's Long Term Evolution Experiment.  

- [Overview of the dataset](dataset/01-intro-to-dataset.html)

### Requirements

This workshop is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow.
*These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools*, but working
through this lesson requires working copies of the software described.
To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to install everything
*before* working through this workshop.
